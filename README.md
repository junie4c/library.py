# library.py
This project involves creating a Python module called library.py to work with strings. It includes three constants for lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and digits, along with eight custom functions for tasks like checking if a string is alphabetic or numeric, converting case, finding or replacing characters and substrings, and more. Youâ€™ll write all the code from scratch without using built-in string methods, imports, or input/output operations. The goal is to build a library that works entirely with basic Python tools like ord() and chr().
